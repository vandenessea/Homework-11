# 11 Express.js: Note Taker



I  modified starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The front end which was given to us was connected to the back end which was created, and the app is deployed through Heroku.

I worked on deleting requests and came up with a method.
